1. go to hadoop-dist/target
2. change the etc/hadoop/core-site.xml first to point to namenode address, set up namenode configurations in hdfs-site.xml
3. changes the JAVA_HOME to amd64 in hadoop-env.sh and start datanode/namenode
4. the examples is in 
'sudo bin/hadoop jar share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar TestDFSIO -write -nrFiles 64 -fileSize 1KB'

go to http://namenode:50070 for information on namenode
